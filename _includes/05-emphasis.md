Life has taken me to various countries in my working career. countries like *Japan*, the *United States of America* and of course my favourite country **Greece**!

I do speak *Japanese* although my handwriting skills are _**far**_ from good.

What else is there to know? I am rekindling my love for coding, having studied computer science and business management at the *University of Applied Sciences* in Wedel, Germany.
